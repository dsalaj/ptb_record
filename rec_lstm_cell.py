  The implementation is based on: http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329.
  We add forget_bias (default: 1) to the biases of the forget gate in order to
  reduce the scale of forgetting in the beginning of the training.
  It does not allow cell clipping, a projection layer, and does not
  use peep-hole connections: it is the basic baseline.
  For advanced models, please use the full @{tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell}
